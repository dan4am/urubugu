## 1. Getting started 
### a. Prerequesites.
- [python 3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- [pygame 2.0.1](https://www.pygame.org/wiki/GettingStarted)
- [numpy 1.20.3](https://numpy.org/install/)

 
### b. Run the code.
After downloading and installing python and the necessary libraries, the user have to run the 
following command to play the game:


- On Windows, Unix-like systems and Mac OS:

```

- Exclusively on windows:

---
The user can download the following file "Executable Files/urubugu v1.1.zip" and launch the .exe file in it.
